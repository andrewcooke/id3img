id3img
======

This is a simple web server that works with
[MPDroid](https://github.com/abarisain/dmix) so that you can see the
album art for your music.

By default, [MPDroid](https://github.com/abarisain/dmix) will pull images
from [Last.fm](http://last.fm), which is OK, but doesn't always get exactly
the right image.  So there is an alternative configuration (see
"Download local cover art") that allows you to pull images from a "web server".
`id3img` provides a suitable web server.
